# Ticket Sales App
With this c# application I made, you can easily buy tickets and cancel them as you wish. You can go wherever you want, whenever you want, with the company you want. You can choose which numbered seat you want to sit in. When the seats change, their occupancy also changes, and if the seat is occupied, it will turn red. Once you cancel the ticket, it becomes available again
